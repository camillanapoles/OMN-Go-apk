// Each lazy file must define every name and give every action that
// omn-go-api.js promises, and it must read no name that nothing defines.
//
// THE FAULT THIS FILE EXISTS TO FIND. The body of omn-go-api.js sits inside
// an `if (protocol !== 'file:')` BLOCK, thus a `const` of that block reaches
// no other file. A lazy file that reads such a name throws a ReferenceError,
// for example "SYNC_TITLES is not defined" at each press of "Commit & Push".
// See doc/decisions/0015-load-the-click-driven-scripts-on-demand.md.
//
// WHY NOTHING CAUGHT IT.
//
//   - `node --check` parses a file. A free variable is valid syntax.
//   - A test that READS the source proves what a file says. This one RUNS
//     the code, which is the rule of CLAUDE.md section 8.
//   - dom-stub.js loads a script with require, and a Node module has its
//     own scope. In a browser `window` IS the global object. The stub
//     therefore reported the fault where a browser has none, and hid it
//     where a browser has one. page-stub.js builds a real page context.
//
// A SIBLING FAULT THAT THIS FILE ALSO COVERS. `applySyncLogLine` is a
// FUNCTION of the same block. Annex B of the standard hoists a function
// declared in a block of sloppy mode, thus omn-go-sync.js found it by
// accident for those same 17 versions. omn-go-api.js now exports it by
// hand. The test below cannot tell the two apart, and it does not need
// to: it fails on either one.
//
// WHAT A FAILURE MEANS. A ReferenceError names a variable that the lazy
// file reads and nothing defines. Move the definition into the lazy file,
// or export it from omn-go-api.js by hand.
//
// A TypeError is NOT a failure. The page here is a stub, and a missing
// element or method of the stub is a gap in the stub.
